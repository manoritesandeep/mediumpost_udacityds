# mediumpost for udacity Data Scientist Project 1:

For this project some of the major libraries for data analytics were utilized
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

The dataset used for this analysis was the Airbnb listings dataset which is available to public on the airbnb website.

Some of the questions of interest that we are going explored in this blog are:
    1) What are the factors that influence the price of Airbnb listings?    
    2) Using listing descriptions, determine the neighborhood choice made by guests?
    3) What are the prices of listings in Seattle. By how much do prices spike? What are the maximum, minimum and mean price of the listings?    
    4) Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
    5) Top 10 host with maximum number of bookings?
    6) Most expensive listings based on neighborhood.

Our analysis of the dataset has provided valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of properties in different regions.
This analysis acts as a foundation for comprehending the distribution of properties based on region and the pricing patterns within the dataset. 
We urge readers to further explore and utilize the dataset to extract valuable insights for their specific needs.
